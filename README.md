### 1. Background and Metadata
#### What is Variant (or SNP) Calling?
#### Variant calling is the process of identifying and cataloging the differences between the observed sequencing reads and a reference genome
#### Variants are usually determined from alignments or BAM files Typical variant calling process:
1. Align reads to the reference genome
2. Correct and refine alignments
3. Determine variants from the alignments
4. Filter the resulting variants for the desired characteristics

#### In the variant calling process you will run into terminologies that are not always used consistently
#### We will attempt to define a few of these terms while making a note that these definitions are not “textbook” definitions designed to accurately capture the proper terminology
### 2. Assessing Read Quality

1. Downloading SRA files:  
    * Make a directory to download fastq files:  
    `$ mkdir -p data/untrimmed_fastq`  
    `$ cd data/untrimmed_fastq`
    * Download fastq files:  
	`$ curl -O ftp://ftp.sra.ebi.ac.uk/vol1/fastq/SRR197/007/SRR1972917/SRR1972917_1.fastq.gz`   
	`$ curl -O ftp://ftp.sra.ebi.ac.uk/vol1/fastq/SRR197/007/SRR1972917/SRR1972917_2.fastq.gz`  
	`$ curl -O ftp://ftp.sra.ebi.ac.uk/vol1/fastq/SRR197/008/SRR1972918/SRR1972918_1.fastq.gz`  
	`$ curl -O ftp://ftp.sra.ebi.ac.uk/vol1/fastq/SRR197/008/SRR1972918/SRR1972918_2.fastq.gz`  
	`$ curl -O ftp://ftp.sra.ebi.ac.uk/vol1/fastq/SRR197/009/SRR1972919/SRR1972919_1.fastq.gz`  
	`$ curl -O ftp://ftp.sra.ebi.ac.uk/vol1/fastq/SRR197/009/SRR1972919/SRR1972919_2.fastq.gz`  
	`$ curl -O ftp://ftp.sra.ebi.ac.uk/vol1/fastq/SRR197/000/SRR1972920/SRR1972920_1.fastq.gz`  
	`$ curl -O ftp://ftp.sra.ebi.ac.uk/vol1/fastq/SRR197/000/SRR1972920/SRR1972920_2.fastq.gz`  
	
2. Lets take a look at one of our fastq files:
	* In order to view our the fastq file, we must decompress it:  
		`$ gunzip SRR1972917_1.fastq.gz`
	* We can view the first complete read in one of the files our dataset by using head to look at the first four lines:  
		`$ head -n 4 SRR1972917_1.fastq`  
    * Output:  
        `@SRR1972917.1 1/1
        TCCGTGGGGCTGGTACGACAGTATCGATGAGGGTGGACGCTTCAAGGTCAAGCGTATACAGGTCAACCCCAAAGCTAGCCTGAGCCTTCAGAAACACCACC  
        +  
        @CCFDDFFHGHHHGIJJIIJJJJGJJJJGIJIJJFIJJJIIJJJJHHFHHFFFFAADEFEDDDDDDDDDDDD??CCCDDDDDDCCCDDCCCDD:?CABDDB`

    * Each quality score represents the probability that the corresponding nucleotide call is incorrect  
    * This quality score is logarithmically based, so a quality score of 10 reflects a base call accuracy of 90%, but a quality score of 20 reflects a base call accuracy of 99%
    * These probability values are the results from the base calling algorithm and depend on how much signal was captured for the base incorporation  
    `Quality encoding: !"#$%&'()*+,-./0123456789:;<=>?@ABCDEFGHIJ`  
    `               |         |         |         |         |  `  
    `Quality score:    01........11........21........31........41`

3. Assessing read quality using FastQC
    * FastQC has a number of features which can give you a quick impression of any problems your data may have, so you can take these issues into consideration before moving forward with your analyses   
    * Rather than looking at quality scores for each individual read, FastQC looks at quality collectively across all reads within a sample  
    * The x-axis displays the base position in the read, and the y-axis shows quality scores  
    * For each position, there is a box-and-whisker plot showing the distribution of quality scores for all reads at that position  
    * The horizontal red line indicates the median quality score and the yellow box shows the 1st to 3rd quartile range  
    * This means that 50% of reads have a quality score that falls within the range of the yellow box at that position  
    * The whiskers show the absolute range, which covers the lowest (0th quartile) to highest (4th quartile) values  
    *The plot background is also color-coded to identify good (green), acceptable (yellow), and bad (red) quality scores  


    `$ fastqc -h`  
    `$ fastqc *.fastq*`  

    * Output should look like this:  
    `application/gzip   
    Started analysis of SRR1972917_1.fastq.gz  
    Approx 5% complete for SRR1972917_1.fastq.gz

    Approx 95% complete for SRR1972917_1.fastq.gz  
    Analysis complete for SRR1972917_1.fastq.gz`  

    * Lets now look at the files created by FastQC:  
    `$ ls` 

    * For each input FASTQ file, FastQC has created a .zip file and a .html file  
    * The .zip file extension indicates that this is actually a compressed set of multiple output files   
    * The .html file is a stable webpage displaying the summary report for each of our samples  
    * We want to keep our data files and our results files separate, so we will move these output files into a new directory within our results/ directory  
    `$ mkdir results/fastqc_untrimmed_reads`  
    `$ mv *.zip results/fastqc_untrimmed_reads`  
    `$ mv *.html results/fastqc_untrimmed_reads`  
    `$ cd results/fastqc_untrimmed_reads`
    * We can now open the .html file to view the FastQC results:  

    <figure>

    </figure>



### 3. Trimming and Filtering

1. Trimming the bad quality reads from our fastq files
    * In the previous episode, we took a high-level look at the quality of each of our samples using FastQC  
    * We visualized per-base quality graphs showing the distribution of read quality at each base across all reads in a sample and extracted information about which samples fail which quality checks  
    * It is very common to have some quality metrics fail, and this may or may not be a problem for your downstream application  
    * For our variant calling workflow, we will be removing some of the low quality sequences to reduce our false positive rate due to sequencing error  
    * We will use a program called Trimmomatic to filter poor quality reads and trim poor quality bases from our samples  
    
    `$ trimmomatic`  
    ``Usage:  
       PE [-version] [-threads <threads>] [-phred33|-phred64] [-trimlog <trimLogFile>] [-summary <statsSummaryFile>] [-quiet] [-validatePairs] [-basein <inputBase> | <inputFile1> <inputFile2>] [-baseout <outputBase> | <outputFile1P> <outputFile1U> <outputFile2P> <outputFile2U>] <trimmer1>...  
   or:  
       SE [-version] [-threads <threads>] [-phred33|-phred64] [-trimlog <trimLogFile>] [-summary <statsSummaryFile>] [-quiet] <inputFile> <outputFile> <trimmer1>...  
   or:  
       -version``  

    * This output shows us that we must first specify whether we have paired end (PE) or single end (SE) reads  
    * Next, we specify what flag we would like to run. For example, you can specify threads to indicate the number of processors on your computer that you want Trimmomatic to use  
    * In most cases using multiple threads (processors) can help to run the trimming faster  
    * These flags are not necessary, but they can give you more control over the command  
    * The flags are followed by positional arguments, meaning the order in which you specify them is important  
    * In paired end mode, Trimmomatic expects the two input files, and then the names of the output files  
    * While, in single end mode, Trimmomatic will expect 1 file as input, after which you can enter the optional settings and lastly the name of the output file  

   * Trimmomatic command options:  
     * ILLUMINACLIP: Cut adapter and other Illumina-specific sequences from the read  
     * SLIDINGWINDOW: Perform a sliding window trimming, cutting once the average
  quality within the window falls below a threshold  
     * LEADING: Cut bases off the start of a read, if below a threshold quality  
     * TRAILING: Cut bases off the end of a read, if below a threshold quality  
     * CROP: Cut the read to a specified length  
     * HEADCROP: Cut the specified number of bases from the start of the read 4
     * MINLEN: Drop the read if it is below a specified length  
     * TOPHRED33: Convert quality scores to Phred-33  
     * TOPHRED64: Convert quality scores to Phred-64  

2. Running Trimmomatic:  
    `$ trimmomatic PE SRR1972917_1.fastq.gz  SRR1972917_2.fastq.gz \`  
    `SRR1972917_1.trim.fastq.gz SRR1972917_1un.trim.fastq.gz \`  
    `SRR1972917_2.trim.fastq.gz SRR1972917_2un.trim.fastq.gz \`  
    `SLIDINGWINDOW:4:20 MINLEN:25 ILLUMINACLIP:NexteraPE-PE.fa:2:40:15`  

    * Output:  
    ``TrimmomaticPE: Started with arguments:

    * List out files created by Trimmomatic:  
    `$ ls SRR1972917*`
    * Trimmed files should be smaller in size than our untrimmed fastq files
  
3. Running a for loop on all fastq files  

    ``$ for infile in *_1.fastq.gz
        do
            base=$(basename ${infile} _1.fastq.gz)
            trimmomatic PE ${infile} ${base}_2.fastq.gz \  
            ${base}_1.trim.fastq.gz ${base}_1un.trim.fastq.gz \  
            ${base}_2.trim.fastq.gz ${base}_2un.trim.fastq.gz \  
            SLIDINGWINDOW:4:20 MINLEN:25 ILLUMINACLIP:NexteraPE-PE.fa:2:40:15   
        done``  

4. Moving trimmed fastq files to a new directory:
    * We have now completed the trimming and filtering steps of our quality control process! Before we move on, let’s move our trimmed FASTQ files to a new subdirectory within our data/ directory  
  
    `$ cd data/untrimmed_fastq`  
    `$ mkdir -p ../trimmed_fastq`  
    `$ mv *trim* ../trimmed_fastq`  
    `$ cd ../trimmed_fastq`  
    `$ ls -al`  

5. Lets rerun FastQC on the trimmed fastq files  
    `$ fastq *trim.fastq.gz`




### 4. Reference Based Mapping  

1. Aligning to a reference genome
    * We perform read alignment or mapping to determine where in the genome our reads originated from  
    * There are a number of tools to choose from and, while there is no gold standard, there are some tools that are better suited for particular NGS analyses  
    * We will be using the Burrows Wheeler Aligner (BWA), which is a software package for mapping low-divergent sequences against a large reference genome  
    * The alignment process consists of two steps:  
        * Indexing the reference genome  
        * Aligning the reads to the reference genome  


2. Downloading reference genome  
   * Navigate to NCBI and search for GenBank accession `AF086833` and download fasta file  
    `$ mkdir -p data/ref_genome`  
    `$ cd data/ref_genome`  

3. Create directories for the results that will be generated as part of this workflow    
    * We can do this in a single line of code, because mkdir can accept multiple new directory names as input  
    `$ mkdir -p results/sam results/bam results/bcf results/vcf`  

4. Index the reference genome  
    * Our first step is to index the reference genome for use by BWA  
    * Indexing allows the aligner to quickly find potential alignment sites for query sequences in a genome, which saves time during alignment  
    * Indexing the reference only has to be run once  
    * The only reason you would want to create a new index is if you are working with a different reference genome or you are using a different tool for alignment  
    `$ bwa index AF086833.fasta`  

5. Align reads to the reference genome  
    * The alignment process consists of choosing an appropriate reference genome to map our reads against and then deciding on an aligner  
    * We will use the BWA-MEM algorithm, which is the latest and is generally recommended for high-quality queries as it is faster and more accurate  
    `$ bwa mem data/ref_genome/AF086833.fasta data/trimmed_fastq/SRR1972917_1.trim.fastq.gz data/trimmed_fastq/SRR1972917_2.trim.fastq.gz > results/sam/SRR1972917.aligned.sam`  

    * The SAM file, is a tab-delimited text file that contains information for each individual read and its alignment to the genome  
    * The compressed binary version of SAM is called a BAM file  
    * We use this version to reduce size and to allow for indexing, which enables efficient random access of the data contained within the file  
    * The file begins with a header, which is optional  
    * The header is used to describe the source of data, reference sequence, method of alignment, etc., this will change depending on the aligner being used  
    * Following the header is the alignment section  
    * Each line that follows corresponds to alignment information for a single read  
    * Each alignment line has 11 mandatory fields for essential mapping information and a variable number of other fields for aligner specific information  
    * An example entry from a SAM file is displayed below with the different fields highlighted  
  
6. Convert SAM file to BAM format  
    `$ samtools view -S -b results/sam/SRR1972917.aligned.sam > results/bam/SRR1972917.aligned.bam`  

7. Sort BAM file by coordinates  
    `$ samtools sort -o results/bam/SRR1972917.aligned.sorted.bam results/bam/SRR1972917.aligned.bam`   

    * Lets take a look at the statistics in our BAM file:  
    `$ samtools flagstat results/bam/SRR1972917.aligned.sorted.bam`  



### 5. Variant Calling

* A variant call is a conclusion that there is a nucleotide difference vs. some reference at a given position in an individual genome or transcriptome, often referred to as a Single Nucleotide Variant (SNV)  
* The call is usually accompanied by an estimate of variant frequency and some measure of confidence  
* Similar to other steps in this workflow, there are a number of tools available for variant calling  
* We will be using bcftools, but there are a few things we need to do before actually calling the variants  

1. Calculate the read coverage of positions in the genome  
   `$ bcftools mpileup -O b -o results/bcf/SRR1972917_raw.bcf -f data/ref_genome/AF086833.fasta results/bam/SRR1972917.aligned.sorted.bam `  

2. Detect the single nucleotide variants (SNVs)  
    * Identify SNVs using bcftools call. We have to specify ploidy with the flag `--ploidy`, which is one for the haploid E. coli. `-m` allows for multiallelic and rare-variant calling, `-v` tells the program to output variant sites only (not every site in the genome), and `-o` specifies where to write the output file:  
    `$ bcftools call --ploidy 1 -m -v -o results/vcf/SRR1972917_variants.vcf results/bcf/SRR1972917_raw.bcf`   

3. Filter and report the SNV variants in variant calling format (VCF)
    * Filter the SNVs for the final output in VCF format, using vcfutils.pl:  
    `$ vcfutils.pl varFilter results/vcf/SRR1972917_variants.vcf  > results/vcf/SRR1972917_final_variants.vcf`  

4. Explore the VCF format
    `$ less -S results/vcf/SRR1972917_final_variants.vcf`  

    * You will see the header (which describes the format), the time and date the file was created, the version of bcftools that was used, the command line parameters used, and some additional information  
    * The first few columns represent the information we have about a predicted variation:  
    <figure>
    <img src="vcf_format1.png" width="500" height="300">
    </figure>

    * The last two columns contain the genotypes and can be tricky to decode:  
    <figure>
    <img src="vcf_format2.png" width="300" height="100">
    </figure>

    * For our file, the metrics presented are GT:PL:GQ:  
    <figure>
    <img src="vcf_format3.png" width="500" height="300">
    </figure>





### 6. Visualizing the Results
* It is often instructive to look at your data in a genome browser  
* Visualization will allow you to get a “feel” for the data, as well as detecting abnormalities and problems  
* Also, exploring the data in such a way may give you ideas for further analyses  
* As such, visualization tools are useful for exploratory analysis  
* We will describe two different tools for visualization: a light-weight command-line based one and the Broad Institute’s Integrative Genomics Viewer (IGV) which requires software installation and transfer of files
1. In order for us to visualize the alignment files, we will need to index the BAM file using samtools:  
    `$ samtools index results/bam/SRR1972917.aligned.sorted.bam`  
2. Viewing with `tview`
    * In order to visualize our mapped reads, we use tview, giving it the sorted bam file and the reference file:  
    `$ samtools tview results/bam/SRR1972917.aligned.sorted.bam data/ref_genome/AF086833.fasta`  

    * The first line of output shows the genome coordinates in our reference genome. The second line shows the reference genome sequence  
    * The third line shows the consensus sequence determined from the sequence reads. 
    * A `.` indicates a match to the reference sequence, so we can see that the consensus from our sample matches the reference in most locations   
    * If that was not the case, we should probably reconsider our choice of reference  
    * Below the horizontal line, we can see all of the reads in our sample aligned with the reference genome  
    * Only positions where the called base differs from the reference are shown  
    * You can use the arrow keys on your keyboard to scroll or type `?` for a help menu   
    * To navigate to a specific position, type `g`  
    * A dialogue box will appear  
    * In this box, type the name of the “chromosome” followed by a colon and the position of the variant you would like to view (e.g. for this sample, type CP000819.1:50 to view the 50th base. Type `Ctrl^C` or `q` to exit tview  
  
3. Viewing with IGV
    * IGV is a stand-alone browser, which has the advantage of being installed locally and providing fast access. Web-based genome browsers, like Ensembl or the UCSC browser, are slower, but provide more functionality  
    * They not only allow for more polished and flexible visualization, but also provide easy access to a wealth of annotations and external data sources  
    * This makes it straightforward to relate your data with information about repeat regions, known genes, epigenetic features or areas of cross-species conservation, to name just a few  
  
    1. Open IGV  
    2. Load our reference genome file (AF086833.fasta) into IGV using the “Load Genomes from File…” option under the “Genomes” pull-down menu  
    3. Load our BAM file (SRR1972917.aligned.sorted.bam) using the “Load from File…” option under the “File” pull-down menu  
    4. Do the same with our VCF file (SRR1972917_final_variants.vcf)  

    <figure>
    <img src="igv_picture.png" width="500" height="300">
    </figure>


    * There should be two tracks: one coresponding to our BAM file and the other for our VCF file  
    * In the VCF track, each bar across the top of the plot shows the allele fraction for a single locus  
    * The second bar shows the genotypes for each locus in each sample  
    * We only have one sample called here, so we only see a single line  
    * Dark blue = heterozygous, Cyan = homozygous variant, Grey = reference  
    * Filtered entries are transparent  
    * Zoom in to inspect variants you see in your filtered VCF file to become more familiar with IGV  
    * See how quality information corresponds to alignment information at those loci
